Phononic transmission calculation for different model configurations of electrodes and the scattering region.
Using the 

> config_dat.json

you can specify your calculation setup as a dictionary. The configuration gives you the options to specify general calculation settings 
but also to define your left (L) elctrode, the central scattering region (C) and the right (R) electrode as you want within the allowed
and reasonable configurations.

In the following, the config_dat.json is shown with explanations for each parameter. Furthermore, there are several ways how you can setup your electrode:

***Debye model***: Only linear chains reasonable.\
***Chain1D***: Analytical setup for a 1D chain.\
***Ribbon2D***: Finite 2D Ribbon with coupling in x, y and xy-direction.\
***AnalyticalFourier***: The (quasi-)infinite electrode is setup analytically by fourier transforming an atom in the periodic y-direction.\
***DecimationFourier***: Whole finite unit cell (L-C-R) is extended periodically in y-direction (transverse to transport).\

After setting the calculation up, you can run it via

> python path/to/main.py path/to/config_dat.json

which will execute the code and write the results to your given data path.
